### Challenge 3 - Medium
### Rock Paper Scissors: The Best Way
# Create a rock-paper-scissors game!
# Like yesterday's challenge, but with arrays & loops.
#
# The game should follow these steps:
#   - ask the player for their choice of rock, paper or scissors
#   - once the player makes their choice, the computer player (AI!) should randomly choose a choice too
#   - decide who the winner is and display the winner
#   - ask the user if they would like to play again
#           - if yes, the game repeats
#           - if no, the game stops
#
# Remember:
# - Rock beats scissors
# - Scissors beats paper
# - Paper beats rock
# ... Is there a sequence or order to that RPS match-up?
#
# This challenge relies on some tricks & pre-made methods that Ruby has for Arrays.
# So, check the Ruby documentation for Arrays!
#
# Here's an array to start you off:
#
possible_choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
