#Step 1: Create a customer database of customerâ€™s name, item ordered and the price.
# Store the customer deets in an array and also save in a text file

# Step 2: define a method to print out customer deets based on the query by customer name.
# If the customer was not found in the database, display customer not found.


# customer_name = ["jeff","john","jimmy","jake","jill"] # a name of customers



# File.open("test.txt", "w+") do |testing|
#     testing.puts(customer_name)
# end


# range = (1..99)
# # puts (range)

# puts "give me a input"
# user_input = gets.chomp


# if  (range === user_input)
#     puts "hey it worked"
# end
